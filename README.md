## üìä Projects
Course Projects 
1. **Lung Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning Model (April 2024) **
‚Ä¢ Developed a lung cancer prediction model analyzing abnormalities in histopathological images. 
‚Ä¢ Compared to three models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), achieving 
an accuracy of 92% with SVM. 
‚Ä¢ We have collected Lung Histopathological images from Kaggle, Total Images: 15000 and we have trained 12000 and 
tested 3000 images 
‚Ä¢ The images which include different types of cancer namely Adenocarcinoma, Squamous cell carcinoma, No cancer 
‚Ä¢ The project demonstrated the feasibility of machine learning for early cancer detection, offering a robust tool for clinical 
decision-making.

2. ** Emotion Recognition Using EEG Sensors (December 2023) **

‚Ä¢ Classified emotional states based on frequency bands (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Theta, Delta). 
‚Ä¢ Implemented models including SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and k-NN. 
‚Ä¢ Achieved the highest accuracy of 85% using Random Forest, addressing challenges of individual differences in emotional 
responses. 
‚Ä¢ This project contributed to advancements in emotion recognition technology, with potential applications in mental health 
and human-computer interaction. 

3.**Air Pollution Modeling and Analysis (Master‚Äôs Project, ongoing)**

‚Ä¢ Conducting an analysis of the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) using R, employing panel data analysis, linear 
regression, and multiple regression techniques. 
‚Ä¢ Aimed at evaluating the program‚Äôs effectiveness in reducing air pollution levels across key regions in India. 
‚Ä¢ Exploring trends and relationships in air quality data to identify areas for improvement in policy implementation. 
‚Ä¢ Research is ongoing, with preliminary findings expected to provide evidence-based policy recommendations for 
enhancing air quality management
